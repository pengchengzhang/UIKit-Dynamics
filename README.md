# UIKit-Dynamics

UIKit Dynamics helps you to implement physics-related capabilities into your animations.

From this project you'll find the basics of UIDynamics and how you can use various behaviors in your animations.
I've created several screens to demonstrate each primitive behaviors in single screen, you can create amazing & cool animations using multiple behaviors simultaneously.
